# damp3ft (download audio mp3 from text)

## Overview
I created this tool out of necessity, I'm studying English and I use a spaced repetition app called Anki, in which we can put texts and audios, however I collected texts over the internet and I didn't have audios for the respective texts, so I put them in Google Translate and listened to the audio, however, I needed to download the audio and for that I created this tool, with it we can make the audio from google translate.

### What is it?
This simple code is an extension for google chrome.

### What it does?
Provides the download of audio in mp3 of what was typed in the text input field.
